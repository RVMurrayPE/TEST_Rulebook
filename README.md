# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Overview
Energy efficiency savings are quantified via measure packages (formerly called workpapers), technical engineering documents that prescribe pre-determined values for energy savings, measure costs, and other ex-ante values. Measure packages are generally used for homogenous, high-volume interventions and have historically been developed by the California program administrators (PAs)[^1] with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) input and approval. The CPUC-maintained Database for Energy Efficiency Resources (DEER) provides support tables and ex ante values that facilitate measure package development.

Energy efficiency programs offer measures that employ either a deemed savings approach or a calculated savings approach for the purpose of estimating energy efficiency savings. A deemed measure is a prescriptive energy efficiency measure that uses CPUC-approved measure attributes including savings calculations, costs (material and labor), lifetimes, net-to-gross, and other eligibility requirements. These values are pulled directly from DEER and may also be developed by PAs with approved assumptions that will be applied consistently to the same measure.
This Statewide Deemed Rulebook (Rulebook) presents a compendium of the current CPUC directives for estimating ex ante savings claims for energy efficiency measures using the deemed savings calculation methods. It is a guide for program implementers (including PAs) to understand the CPUCâ€™s rules and requirements for claiming energy savings from installed deemed energy efficiency measures. This Rulebook is not intended to restrict or impede program design and is not a program guidebook. 

This Rulebook is intended to communicate current deemed savings rules and processes only and is not an official decision or policy manual.

[^1]: The California Program Administrators include four investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas & Electric (PGE), Southern California Edison (SCE), Southern California Gas Company (SCG), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE);  and eleven Regional Energy Networks (RENs) and Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs): Bay Area Regional Energy Network (BAY), East Bay Community Energy (EBCE), Inland Regional Network (IREN), Lancaster Choice Energy (LCE), Marin Clean Energy (MCE), Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE), Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), Sonoma Clean Power (SCP), Southern California Regional Energy Network (SCR), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), and Tri-county Regional Energy Network (TCR).

## 1.2 Document Structure
This document contains two primary sections. Section 2 presents the overarching rules and regulations of energy efficiency in California. All resource program activities should follow the rules in this section, regardless of the savings calculation methodology. Section 2 discusses regulatory rules and procedures specific to the deemed savings calculation approach. To fully understand all the requirements for the deemed savings calculation approach, we recommend reading both Section 2  and Section 3. Each section provides official CPUC rules and requirements. Implementers must comply with CPUC requirements to fulfill the orders within various CPUC decisions, resolutions, rulings, and policies.

We have cited publicly available sources for rules and glossary terms wherever possible. In most cases, rule sources can be found directly on the CPUC website. 

## 1.3 Audience
This Rulebook is intended to provide current and future implementers of California energy efficiency programs a better understanding of the regulatory requirements to be followed when proposing, designing, implementing, and delivering successful programs. We also anticipate that other stakeholders of energy efficiency programs will benefit from the increased transparency and centralized guidance.

## 1.4 Terminology
This Rulebook uses a variety of terms defined in the glossary in Appendix B. For reference, a key to abbreviations used is included in Appendix C.

## 1.5 Versioning
The Rulebook is intended to be a living document that will be updated for clarity and accuracy over time. Any new rules developed by the CPUC or the Program Administrators (PAs) will be incorporated into future versions. The current version and start date are indicated on the cover page. Reference the California eTRM (<https://caetrm.com>) for the current DEER values and measure packages.
